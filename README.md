Mine the Model is a ML contest hosted by Cynaptics Club IIT Indore in collaboration with NJack IIT Patna . The objective of the contest was to build a stock prediction model. For the challenge , we used various deep learning models like FB Prophet, Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) and Long Short Term Memory[LSTM]. After testing out all the approaches, we managed to conclude that LSTM produces the best results with a minimum Root Mean Square Error of 0.12%.
